##Â Sorting
From Algorithms 4th edition:

> "Sorting is the process of rearranging a sequence of objects so as to put them in some logical order. Sorting plays a major role in commercial data processing and in modern scientific computing. Applications abound in transaction processing, combinatorial optimization, astrophysics, molecular dynamics, linguistics, genomics, weather prediction, and many other fields."

| Algorithm      | Time (worst case) | Time (best case) | Time averge | Space       |
| -------------  | -------------     | ------------     | ----------- | --------    |
| Selection sort | ~(n^2)/2          | ~(n^2)/2         | ~(n^2)/2    | In place    |
| Insertion Sort | ~(n^2)/2          | ~n               | ~(n^2)/4    | In place    |
| Shell Sort     | o(n^2)            | O(nlog n)        |  ???        | In place    |
